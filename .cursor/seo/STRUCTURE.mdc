description: "SEO-safe semantic structure rules"

Instructions:
- Use exactly one H1 per page
- H1 must communicate the primary value proposition
- Use H2s for major sections (Services, Portfolio, Experience, Intake)
- Avoid empty, placeholder, or lazy-loaded SEO content
- Ensure critical content is crawlable without client-side execution

Do not replace semantic structure with purely visual components.
