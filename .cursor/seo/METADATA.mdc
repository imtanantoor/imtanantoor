description: "Mandatory SEO metadata requirements for all public pages"
---
Instructions:
- Every public page must include:
  - Meta title (55–60 characters)
  - Meta description (140–160 characters)
  - Canonical URL
  - Open Graph title and description
  - Twitter card metadata

Rules:
- Titles must include primary service or outcome keywords
- Descriptions must describe business value, not technology stacks
- Metadata is required even if not explicitly requested
- Never ship a page without metadata

If metadata is missing, add it by default.
