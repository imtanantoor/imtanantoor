Instructions:
- Include at least one primary CTA above the fold
- CTAs must lead to structured intake, not free-form contact
- CTA text should communicate value, not mechanics

Preferred CTA language:
- “Get a Project Review”
- “Discuss Your Idea”
- “Request a Project Estimate”

Avoid:
- “Contact Me”
- “Send Message”

CTAs exist to start qualification, not conversation.
