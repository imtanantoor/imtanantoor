Instructions:
- Lead capture must be structured and explicit

Required fields:
- name (string)
- email (string)
- project_type (enum)
- project_stage (enum)
- project_goal (short text)

Rules:
- Do not use open-ended “message” fields
- Use semantically clear field names
- Data must be easy to map to PRDs and feature lists
- The form must function without AI or automation

Assume all captured data will later be processed programmatically.
