description: "Guidelines to ensure future AI compatibility without implementation"

Instructions:
- Use explicit, descriptive field names
- Avoid overloaded or ambiguous concepts
- Structure data so it can map cleanly to:
  - PRD sections
  - Feature extraction
  - Timeline estimation
  - Cost estimation

Do not implement AI in Phase 1.
Only shape data for future intelligence.
