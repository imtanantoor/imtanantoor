Instructions:
- The landing page must clearly state:
  - Who the service is for
  - What outcome is delivered
- Provide visible proof of execution (projects, experience, validation)
- Guide users toward structured lead intake

Hero section rules:
- Include a static primary value proposition
- Animated or rotating text is optional and secondary
- Trust signals must appear above the fold

Avoid generic developer-centric language.
Focus on outcomes and delivery confidence.
