# Landing Page Positioning Rules

Target ICP:
- Non-technical founders
- Idea-stage (no finalized design)
- Want production-ready v1
- Timeline: 8–12 weeks
- Budget: $3k+ web, $5k+ mobile
- Sensitive to reputation and time risk

Landing page copy MUST:
- Clearly state who this is for
- Explicitly state who this is NOT for
- Emphasize outcomes over implementation
- Set expectations on timeline and seriousness
- Use one dominant CTA

Avoid:
- Generic portfolio language
- Developer-centric jargon
- “For everyone” messaging
