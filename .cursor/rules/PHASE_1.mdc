Current phase is PHASE 1.

Phase 1 objectives:
- Optimize the landing page for conversion
- Enforce SEO fundamentals
- Implement a structured, manual lead intake flow
- Prepare data structures for future AI processing

Explicitly forbidden in Phase 1:
- AI chatbots or conversational agents
- LLM or OpenAI API usage
- Automated PRD generation
- Background jobs, queues, or workflows
- CRM or email automation
- Analytics beyond SEO metadata readiness

If a feature can be implemented later using AI, only prepare structure now.
