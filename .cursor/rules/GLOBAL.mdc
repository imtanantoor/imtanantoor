description: "Global rules for portfolio as a conversion-focused lead system"
---

You are working on a professional portfolio website whose primary purpose is lead acquisition.

Instructions:
- Optimize all changes for business clarity, trust, and conversion
- Assume the primary audience is non-technical business decision makers
- Prefer explicit structure over implicit or inferred behavior
- Avoid novelty or cleverness that reduces clarity
- Do not introduce features that prioritize aesthetics over conversion

Examples of preferred patterns:
- Clear CTAs over subtle design elements
- Explicit form labels over placeholder-only inputs
- Trust indicators (testimonials, logos) over decorative graphics

If a request conflicts with phase-specific rules, warn instead of executing.
