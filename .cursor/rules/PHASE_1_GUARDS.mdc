# Phase 1 Guardrails

Phase 1 guarantees MUST NOT be broken in any later phase.

Do NOT:
- Change semantic HTML structure
- Alter metadata strategy
- Modify Hero hierarchy
- Reposition or dilute the primary CTA
- Change Strapi from read-only usage

If a suggestion risks SEO, trust, or intake stability → reject it.
